## My Approach

### Problem: 
One of the initial challenges faced by people working from home is balancing work and household chores while keeeping everything in an organized manner

### Scenario:
Indoor tracking, also referred to as indoor positioning, uses a network of devices to locate people and objects usually within a building where GPS would fail entirely or lack precision. Most indoor tracking systems use WiFi, Bluetooth, or ultra-wideband technology. Indoor tracking is often one of the most helpful features of a smart environment or smart building and requires technologies which can work together with an IoT platform. This article will walk through indoor tracking and positioning use cases, benefits, technology, and the advantages of using these systems with an IoT platform.

### Solution
Indoor tracking in a smart environment can lead to many benefits. The tracking of shared assets such as whiteboard carts, computers, bikes, or toolboxes help people spend less time looking for assets. Indoor tracking of these items also helps ensure that assets are being utilized efficiently and that data is available to justify buying additional assets if necessary.

Within smart environments, hot desking is becoming more and more popular. With indoor tracking, available hot desks can easily be visualized and found. Tracking technology can also make finding an employee easier.
